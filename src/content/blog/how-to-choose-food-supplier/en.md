## Why Supplier Selection Is Critical

In food trading, your supplier is your reputation. A reliable supplier means consistent quality, on-time delivery, and peace of mind. A poor supplier means product recalls, lost customers, and financial loss.

This guide provides a practical framework for evaluating potential food suppliers in Europe.

## The 10-Point Supplier Evaluation Checklist

### 1. Legal Registration and EU Compliance
Verify that the supplier is legally registered in an EU country (or has proper import authorization). Check company registration numbers, VAT ID, and business history.

**Why it matters:** EU-registered companies must comply with food safety regulations. This is your first layer of protection.

### 2. Food Safety Certifications
Look for internationally recognized certifications:
- **ISO 22000** — Food safety management
- **HACCP** — Hazard analysis (mandatory in EU)
- **BRC / IFS** — Retailer-standard certifications
- **FSSC 22000** — Advanced food safety system

**Red flag:** A supplier who cannot provide any food safety certification.

### 3. Product Quality Documentation
Always request a Certificate of Analysis (COA) for every shipment. The COA should include: acidity levels, peroxide value, color index, moisture content, and any contaminants tested.

**Red flag:** Supplier hesitates to provide COA or provides outdated documents.

### 4. Track Record and References
Ask for references from existing clients, especially in your market. How long have they been in business? Do they have repeat customers?

**Red flag:** New company with no verifiable track record.

### 5. Pricing Transparency
A reliable supplier provides clear pricing with all components visible: product price, packaging costs, delivery charges, and any additional fees. Be wary of unusually low prices — they often indicate quality compromises.

**Red flag:** Prices significantly below market average without explanation.

### 6. Communication Quality
Evaluate response times, language capabilities, and willingness to answer technical questions. Good communication is a leading indicator of good service.

**Red flag:** Slow responses, vague answers, or only communicating via informal channels.

### 7. Logistics Capability
Can the supplier handle your delivery requirements? Check their experience with your preferred Incoterms (FOB/CIF/DAP), their logistics partners, and delivery timeframes.

### 8. Payment Security
Understand the payment terms offered. Standard options include:
- **T/T (Telegraphic Transfer)** — Direct bank transfer
- **L/C (Letter of Credit)** — Bank-guaranteed payment
- **CAD (Cash Against Documents)** — Payment upon document receipt

**Red flag:** Supplier demands 100% advance payment with no track record.

### 9. Sample Availability
A serious supplier will provide product samples for quality testing before you commit to a large order. Expect to pay for shipping but the samples themselves should be free or at minimal cost.

### 10. Contractual Clarity
The supplier should be willing to sign a proper sales contract covering: product specifications, quality parameters, delivery schedule, payment terms, dispute resolution, and force majeure clauses.

## Questions to Ask a Potential Supplier

1. "Can you provide your company registration and EU food operator number?"
2. "What food safety certifications do you hold?"
3. "Can I see a COA from your most recent shipment?"
4. "Can you provide 2-3 references from European clients?"
5. "What are your standard payment terms?"
6. "What Incoterms do you work with?"
7. "Can you send product samples?"
8. "What is your lead time from order to delivery?"
