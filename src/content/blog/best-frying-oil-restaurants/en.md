## Choosing the Right Frying Oil Matters

For restaurants, choosing frying oil isn't just about flavor — it affects food quality, operating costs, kitchen safety, and increasingly, customer perception. The wrong oil can increase costs by thousands of euros per year.

## The Top 5 Frying Oils Compared

### 1. Standard Refined Sunflower Oil
The workhorse of European kitchens. Affordable, widely available, and versatile.

- **Smoke point:** 225°C
- **Frying cycles:** 8-12 before replacement
- **Cost:** $1,100-1,200/ton
- **Taste:** Neutral
- **Health:** Moderate — high in polyunsaturated fats (omega-6)
- **Best for:** General frying, budget-conscious operations

### 2. High-Oleic Sunflower Oil
The premium upgrade. Same neutral taste but dramatically better frying performance.

- **Smoke point:** 230°C+
- **Frying cycles:** 20-30 before replacement
- **Cost:** $1,300-1,450/ton
- **Taste:** Neutral
- **Health:** Good — high monounsaturated fats (like olive oil)
- **Best for:** High-volume frying, quality-focused restaurants

### 3. Palm Oil
Widely used globally but facing consumer backlash in Europe.

- **Smoke point:** 230°C
- **Frying cycles:** 15-20
- **Cost:** $800-950/ton
- **Taste:** Slightly sweet
- **Health:** Mixed — high in saturated fats
- **Best for:** Industrial food production, price-sensitive markets
- **Drawback:** "Palm oil free" trend in Europe reduces appeal

### 4. Rapeseed (Canola) Oil
Popular in Northern Europe, good all-round option.

- **Smoke point:** 205°C
- **Frying cycles:** 8-12
- **Cost:** $1,000-1,150/ton
- **Taste:** Mild, slightly nutty
- **Health:** Good — balanced fatty acid profile
- **Best for:** Light frying, sautéing, Northern European cuisine

### 5. Olive Oil (Refined)
Premium option for Mediterranean restaurants.

- **Smoke point:** 210°C (refined)
- **Frying cycles:** 10-15
- **Cost:** $3,500-5,000/ton
- **Taste:** Mild olive flavor
- **Health:** Excellent — high monounsaturated fats
- **Best for:** Mediterranean restaurants, premium positioning
- **Drawback:** Very high cost for deep frying

## Our Recommendation

For most European restaurants, **high-oleic sunflower oil** offers the best balance of performance, cost, and health benefits. Despite the higher per-ton price, the extended frying life makes it more economical than standard oils in actual use.

For operations focused on lowest cost, **standard refined sunflower oil** remains an excellent choice — especially when sourced at competitive wholesale prices.
