## Why Label Design Matters in Food Trading

In the B2B food industry, product labels serve a critical role beyond legal compliance. They communicate professionalism, build brand recognition, and create trust with distributors and retailers. A well-designed label can be the difference between securing a partnership and being passed over.

When we launched the Star Food brand, we knew that investing in professional label design was essential for our European market positioning.

## Working with a Professional Designer

For the Star Food label project, we partnered with [Anastasiia Kolisnyk](https://akillustrator.com), a professional illustrator and designer based in Slovakia. Anastasiia specializes in product packaging, branding, and illustration — making her the perfect fit for our food label needs.

## The Design Process

### Step 1: Brand Brief
We provided Anastasiia with our brand requirements:
- **Brand identity:** Star Food — quality European food products
- **Color palette:** Blue (trust, quality) + Yellow (sunflower, warmth)
- **Target market:** European wholesale buyers and retailers
- **Legal requirements:** EU food labeling regulations, multilingual text
- **Languages on label:** English, Bulgarian, Greek, Polish, Ukrainian

### Step 2: Concept Development
Anastasiia developed several concepts for the label, focusing on:
- The Star Food circular logo as the central element
- A sunflower field imagery to represent the product's natural origin
- Clean, readable typography for nutritional information
- Color-coded sections for easy navigation of label information
- Premium feel that communicates quality to B2B buyers

### Step 3: Refinement and Testing
The initial concepts went through multiple rounds of feedback:
- Adjusted the sunflower imagery for stronger visual impact
- Optimized text sizing for readability at bottle scale
- Ensured all EU-mandated nutritional information was properly positioned
- Verified the design worked across different bottle sizes (1L, 3L, 5L)

### Step 4: Final Production
The final label design includes:
- **Front panel:** Star Food logo, product name, volume, key certifications
- **Back panel:** Complete nutritional information, ingredients, storage conditions
- **Side panels:** Company details, barcode, batch number space
- **Multilingual text:** All required information in 5 languages

## The Result

The Star Food label design has become a key asset in our business development. Distributors consistently comment on the professional appearance of our packaging, and the clear, multilingual labeling makes our products ready for multiple European markets without repackaging.

## What We Learned About Food Label Design

Based on our experience, here are key considerations for anyone developing food product labels for the European market:

1. **Start with regulatory requirements** — EU food labeling regulations are strict. Design around compliance, not the other way around.
2. **Invest in professional design** — B2B buyers judge quality by packaging. A cheap-looking label undermines your product positioning.
3. **Plan for multiple languages** — If you're selling across Europe, design your label to accommodate multilingual text from the start.
4. **Think about shelf presence** — How does your label look next to competitors? Stand out while maintaining professionalism.
5. **Consider all bottle sizes** — The design should scale from 1L PET to 5L without losing impact.
