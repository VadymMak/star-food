## Why Bulgaria for Food Trading?

Bulgaria might not be the first country that comes to mind when thinking about European food trading. Yet for companies like UB Market, Bulgaria offers a unique combination of strategic advantages that make it one of the most efficient locations for food commodity trading in the EU.

## Advantage 1: Full EU Membership Since 2007

Bulgaria has been a full member of the European Union since January 1, 2007. This means:

- **Zero trade barriers** with all 27 EU member states — no customs duties, no border inspections, no import quotas
- **Single market access** — products cleared in Bulgaria are cleared for the entire EU
- **Harmonized regulations** — EU food safety standards apply uniformly
- **VAT reverse charge** — Simplified taxation on intra-EU B2B transactions

For food buyers in Western Europe, purchasing from a Bulgaria-based trading company is legally and practically identical to buying from a company in Germany or France — but at significantly lower cost.

## Advantage 2: Gateway to Eastern European Producers

Bulgaria sits at the geographic crossroads between Eastern European agricultural powerhouses and Western European consumer markets.

| Producer Country | Distance to Varna | Key Products |
|-----------------|-------------------|--------------|
| **Ukraine** | 600 km (Black Sea) | Sunflower oil, grain, corn |
| **Turkey** | 350 km | Sunflower oil, hazelnuts, dried fruit |
| **Romania** | 150 km (border) | Sunflower oil, corn, wheat |
| **Moldova** | 400 km | Sunflower oil, wine, grain |
| **Serbia** | 300 km | Sugar, oils, dairy |
| **Greece** | 400 km | Olive oil, dairy, produce |

This proximity means lower logistics costs (30-50% savings), faster delivery (1-3 days), direct factory relationships, and first-hand market intelligence.

## Advantage 3: Black Sea Port Access

Bulgaria has two major ports — **Varna** and **Burgas** — critical for food commodity trading:

- Direct shipping routes to Turkey, Ukraine, Georgia
- Connection to global lanes via the Bosphorus Strait
- Bulk cargo terminals for liquid commodities
- Competitive port fees vs. Rotterdam or Hamburg
- Black Sea region produces over 60% of world's sunflower oil

UB Market's location in Varna provides direct access to the Port of Varna — a key node in the global sunflower oil supply chain.

## Advantage 4: Competitive Operating Costs

Bulgaria offers the lowest operating costs in the EU while maintaining full regulatory compliance.

| Cost Factor | Bulgaria | Germany | France | Poland |
|------------|---------|---------|--------|--------|
| **Corporate tax** | **10%** | 30% | 25% | 19% |
| **Office rent/m2** | EUR 8-12 | EUR 25-40 | EUR 20-35 | EUR 12-18 |
| **Avg salary (specialist)** | EUR 800-1,200 | EUR 3,500-5,000 | EUR 2,800-4,000 | EUR 1,200-1,800 |

The **10% flat corporate tax** is the lowest in the EU and has been stable since 2007. For a trading company, this alone can save tens of thousands of euros annually.

## Advantage 5: Own Sunflower Production

Bulgaria is itself a significant sunflower-producing country:

- **~2 million tons** of sunflower seeds annually
- **~800,000 hectares** dedicated to sunflower cultivation
- Top 5 EU producer (after Romania and France)
- Multiple domestic crushing plants and refineries
- Both crude and refined sunflower oil available domestically

This means UB Market has access to **domestic Bulgarian production** plus imports from neighboring countries.

## The Combined Advantage

Together, these five factors create a **compounding advantage**:

1. EU membership eliminates trade barriers with 27 countries
2. Geographic position provides access to cheapest production regions
3. Black Sea ports enable efficient global logistics
4. Low costs allow competitive pricing with healthy margins
5. Domestic production adds supply security and flexibility

This is why UB Market chose Bulgaria as its base.
