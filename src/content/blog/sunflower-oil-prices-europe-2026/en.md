## Market Trends for 2026

### Supply Side
Ukraine remains the world's largest sunflower oil exporter, despite ongoing logistical challenges. The 2025/26 harvest was moderate, with production estimated at approximately 10.5 million tons of sunflower seeds — down 8% from the previous season. This has put upward pressure on prices.

Russia's export restrictions continue to influence global availability. Argentina and Turkey remain important secondary sources.

### Demand Side
European demand for sunflower oil remains strong, driven by the food manufacturing sector and consumer preference for sunflower oil over palm oil. The "palm oil free" trend in Western Europe continues to boost sunflower oil consumption.

Turkey has emerged as a major buyer, importing significant volumes for both domestic consumption and re-export as processed food products.

### Key Price Drivers in 2026

1. **Harvest volumes** — The 2026 planting season outlook will be critical. Weather conditions in Ukraine, Russia, and Argentina will determine supply levels.
2. **Logistics costs** — Freight rates for Black Sea shipping remain volatile.
3. **Currency movements** — USD/EUR and USD/TRY exchange rates directly impact pricing.
4. **Competing oils** — Palm oil and soybean oil prices create a reference floor.
5. **Energy costs** — Refining and transportation costs tied to energy prices.

## Price Comparison by Region

| Destination | Avg. CIF Price (Refined) | Notes |
|-------------|------------------------|-------|
| Western Europe (Germany, France) | $1,250-1,300/ton | Premium market, strict quality |
| Southern Europe (Italy, Spain, Greece) | $1,200-1,260/ton | High consumption volume |
| Turkey | $1,150-1,230/ton | Growing import demand |
| Romania, Bulgaria | $1,100-1,180/ton | Proximity to production |
| Poland, Czech Republic | $1,200-1,260/ton | Growing market |

## Price Forecast: Q2-Q4 2026

Based on current market indicators, we expect:

- **Q2 2026:** Slight increase ($20-40/ton) due to pre-planting uncertainty
- **Q3 2026:** Stabilization as new harvest outlook becomes clear
- **Q4 2026:** Dependent on harvest — could see decrease if yields are strong

The overall trend for 2026 is **moderately bullish**, with prices expected to remain above 2024 levels due to tighter global supplies.

## How to Lock in Competitive Prices

As an EU-registered food trading company, UB Market offers several advantages:

- **Direct sourcing** from producers — no middlemen markups
- **Volume discounts** for orders above 100 tons
- **Forward contracts** — lock in today's price for future delivery
- **Flexible payment** — T/T, L/C, and installment options

## Packaging and Delivery Impact on Price

Bulk delivery via flexitank (20-24 tons) is typically $30-50/ton cheaper than PET bottle delivery due to packaging savings. For retailers needing bottled product, we offer Star Food branded or private label options.
