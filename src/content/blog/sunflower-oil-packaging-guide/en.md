## Why Packaging Choice Matters

The right packaging affects your total cost, shelf life, logistics, and target market. Choosing correctly can save thousands per shipment.

## Packaging Options Compared

### PET Bottles (1L, 3L, 5L)
The standard retail format. Clear plastic bottles that consumers recognize on store shelves.

- **Best for:** Retail distribution, small HORECA
- **MOQ:** 1 pallet (~800-1,200 bottles depending on size)
- **Cost impact:** Highest per-liter cost (packaging adds $150-250/ton)
- **Shelf life:** 12-18 months
- **Pros:** Consumer-ready, brand visibility, easy storage
- **Cons:** Higher cost, more storage space per liter

### PET Bottles (10L, 18L)
Larger format for food service and light industrial use.

- **Best for:** Restaurants, cafeterias, small food producers
- **MOQ:** 1 pallet
- **Cost impact:** Medium ($100-150/ton above bulk)
- **Shelf life:** 12-18 months
- **Pros:** Convenient handling, no special equipment needed
- **Cons:** Still more expensive than bulk

### IBC Containers (1,000L)
Intermediate Bulk Containers — reusable plastic containers in a metal cage.

- **Best for:** Medium-volume buyers, food manufacturers
- **MOQ:** 1-20 containers per order
- **Cost impact:** Low-medium ($50-80/ton above bulk)
- **Shelf life:** 12 months
- **Pros:** Reusable, easy to move with forklift, good middle ground
- **Cons:** Requires forklift, return logistics

### Flexitanks (20-24 tons)
Single-use bags fitted inside standard shipping containers. The most popular bulk format.

- **Best for:** Large wholesale, international trade
- **MOQ:** 20-24 tons (one container)
- **Cost impact:** Low ($20-30/ton above FOB base)
- **Shelf life:** 6-9 months (shorter due to single-wall protection)
- **Pros:** Cost-effective, no return logistics, fits standard containers
- **Cons:** Single use, needs pump for unloading, shorter shelf life

### Bulk Tanker (20-40 tons)
Dedicated road tanker trucks for direct delivery.

- **Best for:** Large-volume buyers, refineries, factories
- **MOQ:** 20 tons (full truck)
- **Cost impact:** Lowest (base FOB price)
- **Shelf life:** Immediate use recommended
- **Pros:** Cheapest per liter, direct delivery to storage tank
- **Cons:** Requires storage tanks, pump equipment
