## The European Food Trading Landscape

The European Union is the world's largest food trading bloc, with intra-EU food trade exceeding **EUR 500 billion annually**. Behind every product on a supermarket shelf lies a complex supply chain of producers, traders, distributors, and retailers — connected by standardized regulations, trade agreements, and logistics networks.

Whether you're a food manufacturer looking to export, an importer seeking new suppliers, or a business exploring the food industry, understanding how this system works is essential.

## The 4 Key Players in Food Trading

### 1. Producers / Manufacturers
Companies that grow, process, or manufacture food products. In the sunflower oil sector: seed crushers, refineries, and bottling plants. Most producers prefer selling in bulk to a small number of large buyers.

### 2. Trading Companies
**This is what UB Market does.** Trading companies act as intermediaries between producers and importers. They add value through sourcing, quality assurance, logistics, risk management, and market knowledge. Especially valuable in cross-border trade where language barriers and complex regulations create friction.

### 3. Importers / Distributors
Companies that buy food products for their domestic market: national distributors, regional wholesalers, specialty importers, and HORECA distributors.

### 4. End Users
Retail consumers, restaurants and hotels, food manufacturers using raw ingredients.

## The 8-Step Trade Process

### Step 1: Market Research and Sourcing
The trading company identifies demand in target markets and sources products from producers who can meet quality, volume, and price requirements. This involves monitoring commodity prices, maintaining producer relationships, and tracking harvest forecasts.

### Step 2: Inquiry and Initial Contact
The buyer sends an inquiry specifying product type and specifications, volume needed, delivery terms (FOB, CIF, or DAP), destination, and required certifications.

### Step 3: Price Negotiation
Pricing depends on current commodity market rates, quality specifications, volume, delivery terms, payment terms, and contract duration.

### Step 4: Contract and Documentation
A formal sales contract covers product specifications (with reference to COA), quantity and delivery schedule, price and currency, payment terms, delivery terms (Incoterms 2020), quality claims procedure, and force majeure clause.

### Step 5: Payment Security
International food trade uses several payment mechanisms:

| Method | Risk for Buyer | Risk for Seller | Common Use |
|--------|---------------|-----------------|------------|
| **Advance payment** | High | Low | New relationships |
| **Letter of Credit (L/C)** | Low | Low | Standard for large deals |
| **Documentary collection** | Medium | Medium | Established partners |
| **Open account (30-60 days)** | Low | High | Long-term partners |

For first-time transactions, a **confirmed Letter of Credit** from a reputable bank is the gold standard.

### Step 6: Production and Quality Control
Key checkpoints: pre-shipment inspection (SGS, Bureau Veritas), Certificate of Analysis (COA), Certificate of Origin, and Health Certificate.

### Step 7: Logistics and Transport
Road transport (1-5 days within EU), sea freight (2-6 weeks intercontinental), or rail. Documentation: Bill of Lading/CMR, commercial invoice, packing list, customs declaration.

### Step 8: Delivery and Settlement
Goods arrive, are inspected, and payment is released per contract terms.

## EU Regulations Governing Food Trade

### EC 178/2002 — General Food Law
- **Traceability** — "one step back, one step forward"
- **Safety** — Food on the EU market must be safe
- **Responsibility** — Operators are responsible for safety

### EU 1169/2011 — Food Information to Consumers
Requires detailed labeling: ingredients, allergens, nutrition, origin, storage conditions, use-by date.

### Within the EU (Intra-Community Trade)
Trade between EU member states is significantly simpler: no customs duties, no border checks, single market regulations, simplified documentation. This is why having an EU-based trading company adds significant value.

## 7 Ways Trading Companies Add Value

1. **Supplier verification** — Factory visits, certification checks
2. **Price optimization** — Competitive pricing through volume aggregation
3. **Quality assurance** — Independent testing, COA verification
4. **Logistics management** — Door-to-door coordination
5. **Payment security** — Transaction structuring
6. **Market intelligence** — Price trends, forecasts, regulatory changes
7. **Problem resolution** — Mediation for delays and quality claims
