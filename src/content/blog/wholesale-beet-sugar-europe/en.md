## The European Beet Sugar Market

Europe is the world's largest beet sugar producing region, with the EU accounting for approximately 50% of global beet sugar output. Unlike cane sugar (produced in tropical countries), beet sugar is grown and processed locally in Europe — making it a key commodity for European food businesses.

## Beet Sugar vs Cane Sugar

For food manufacturers and buyers, an important question is whether beet and cane sugar are interchangeable. The answer is: **yes, for most applications.**

| Feature | Beet Sugar | Cane Sugar |
|---------|-----------|------------|
| Sucrose content | 99.9%+ | 99.9%+ |
| Taste | Identical | Identical |
| Chemical composition | Identical | Identical |
| Production | European local | Tropical imports |
| Certification | EU regulated | Variable |
| Price | Competitive | Variable (transport adds cost) |
| Carbon footprint | Lower (local) | Higher (shipping) |

The only differences are in trace minerals and molasses characteristics — irrelevant for refined white sugar. For European buyers, beet sugar offers supply security and shorter supply chains.

## Quality Grades

### ICUMSA 45 (White Refined)
The standard for retail and food manufacturing. Crystal clear, uniform grain size, no color or odor. This is what you'll find in supermarkets and most food production.

### ICUMSA 100-150 (Off-White)
Slightly less refined. Used in industrial food production where perfect whiteness isn't required. Lower price point.

### ICUMSA 600-1200 (Raw/Brown)
Minimally processed. Used in specialty foods, brewing, and some food manufacturing. Distinct caramel flavor.

## Current Pricing (2026)

| Grade | Price Range (FOB) | Notes |
|-------|------------------|-------|
| ICUMSA 45 | €650-750/ton | Standard retail grade |
| ICUMSA 100-150 | €580-650/ton | Industrial grade |
| ICUMSA 600+ | €500-580/ton | Raw sugar |

*Prices vary by origin, volume, and market conditions.*

1. **France** — EU's largest producer (~5 million tons/year)
2. **Germany** — Second largest (~4 million tons/year)
3. **Poland** — Major Eastern European producer
4. **Netherlands** — Significant processing hub
5. **Belgium** — Important sugar refining center
6. **Turkey** — Major producer outside EU

## How to Source Quality Sugar

When evaluating sugar suppliers, check for:

1. **ICUMSA certification** — Verified color grade
2. **EU food safety compliance** — For European markets
3. **Consistent supply** — Can the supplier deliver year-round?
4. **Packaging quality** — Proper food-grade packaging
5. **Documentation** — COA, phytosanitary certificates, origin documents
