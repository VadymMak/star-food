## Understanding the Two Main Types of Sunflower Oil

When sourcing sunflower oil wholesale, the first decision buyers face is choosing between **crude** and **refined** sunflower oil. Each type serves different industries and end-use applications, and understanding the differences is critical for making cost-effective purchasing decisions.

At UB Market, we supply both crude and refined sunflower oil from verified Eastern European producers. This guide explains what sets them apart and helps you determine which type is right for your business.

## What Is Crude Sunflower Oil?

Crude sunflower oil (CSO) is the first product extracted from sunflower seeds through mechanical pressing or solvent extraction. After extraction, it undergoes only basic filtration to remove solid particles. The oil retains its natural color (dark golden to amber), distinctive nutty flavor, and all naturally occurring compounds — including waxes, phospholipids, free fatty acids, and tocopherols (vitamin E).

**Production process:**
1. Seed cleaning and preparation
2. Mechanical pressing or solvent extraction
3. Basic filtration (no chemical treatment)
4. Storage in food-grade tanks

Crude sunflower oil is primarily an **industrial intermediate** — most CSO goes to refineries for further processing. However, it also has direct applications in certain food products and industrial uses.

## What Is Refined Sunflower Oil?

Refined sunflower oil (RSO) undergoes a multi-stage purification process that removes impurities, free fatty acids, waxes, color pigments, and volatile compounds. The result is a light-colored, neutral-tasting oil with a high smoke point — ideal for cooking, frying, and food manufacturing.

**Refining process:**
1. **Degumming** — removes phospholipids and gums
2. **Neutralization** — removes free fatty acids with alkali
3. **Bleaching** — removes color pigments with bleaching earth
4. **Winterization** — removes waxes (prevents cloudiness at low temperatures)
5. **Deodorization** — removes volatile compounds at high temperature under vacuum

Each step adds processing cost but produces a standardized, shelf-stable product that meets international food safety standards.

## Quality Parameter Comparison

| Parameter | Crude Sunflower Oil | Refined Sunflower Oil |
|-----------|--------------------|-----------------------|
| **Color** | Dark golden to amber | Light yellow, transparent |
| **Taste/Odor** | Nutty, distinctive | Neutral, bland |
| **Acidity (FFA)** | 1.0–3.0% | ≤ 0.1% |
| **Peroxide value** | Up to 15 meq/kg | ≤ 5 meq/kg |
| **Smoke point** | 160–180°C | 220–230°C |
| **Moisture** | Up to 0.2% | ≤ 0.1% |
| **Wax content** | Present | Removed (winterized) |
| **Shelf life** | 4–6 months | 12–18 months |
| **Color (Lovibond)** | 35Y / 6R | 12Y / 1.2R |
| **Vitamin E** | High (natural) | Reduced (processing loss) |

## Pricing Comparison (Q1 2026)

| Type | FOB Black Sea | CIF Rotterdam | CIF Istanbul |
|------|--------------|---------------|--------------|
| **Crude (CSO)** | $950–1,050/ton | $1,020–1,120/ton | $990–1,080/ton |
| **Refined (RSO)** | $1,100–1,200/ton | $1,170–1,280/ton | $1,140–1,240/ton |
| **Premium difference** | +$150–200/ton | +$150–200/ton | +$150–200/ton |

The refining premium of **$150–200 per ton** reflects processing costs and the added value of a ready-to-use product.

## When to Buy Crude Sunflower Oil

Crude oil is the right choice if you:

- **Own or contract a refinery** — You can process CSO into refined oil at your facility, potentially saving on the refining premium
- **Manufacture industrial products** — Biodiesel, oleochemicals, paints, or lubricants that use oil as a raw material
- **Produce specialty food products** — Some artisanal food producers prefer crude oil for its natural flavor profile
- **Trade as an intermediary** — Buying crude and selling to refineries in destination markets

**Typical buyers:** Refineries, biodiesel plants, oleochemical manufacturers, commodity traders

## When to Buy Refined Sunflower Oil

Refined oil is the right choice if you:

- **Distribute to retail** — Supermarkets and grocery stores sell refined oil to consumers
- **Supply HORECA** — Restaurants, hotels, and catering companies need high smoke point oil for frying
- **Manufacture food products** — Mayonnaise, sauces, margarine, snack foods, and baked goods require neutral-tasting, standardized oil
- **Need longer shelf life** — Refined oil lasts 12–18 months vs 4–6 months for crude
- **Import to markets with strict regulations** — Most consumer food safety standards require refined oil

**Typical buyers:** Food distributors, supermarket chains, food manufacturers, HORECA suppliers

## Certificate of Analysis (COA) Requirements

When purchasing either type, always request a **Certificate of Analysis** from an accredited laboratory (SGS, Bureau Veritas, Intertek). Key parameters to verify:

**For Crude Oil:**
- Free fatty acid content (FFA)
- Moisture and volatile matter
- Peroxide value
- Phosphorus content
- Wax content
- Pesticide residues

**For Refined Oil:**
- All of the above, plus:
- Color (Lovibond)
- Smoke point
- Cold test (winterization verification)
- Trans fat content
- Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH)

## Making Your Decision

The choice ultimately comes down to your **business model** and **end use**:

- If you have refining capacity or sell to refineries → **buy crude** (lower cost per ton)
- If you sell to consumers or food businesses → **buy refined** (ready to use, longer shelf life)
- If you're unsure → [contact us](/en/quote) for a consultation. We can supply both types and help you determine the best option for your market.
